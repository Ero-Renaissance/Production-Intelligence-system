Data Requirements Document: Production Performance Monitoring System
Version: 1.6 Date: July 12, 2025 Author: Osahon
1. Introduction
This document outlines the complete data requirements for the design and implementation of an Oil and Gas Production Performance Monitoring System. The primary objectives of this system are to:
Automatically identify, flag, and manage production underperformance across the entire value chain.
Forecast terminal inventory and predict readiness for export cargos.
Support production optimization by recommending operational adjustments to meet system constraints and maximize output.
This document will serve as the foundational blueprint for creating the detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and the subsequent database schema. It details all required entities, their attributes, the relationships between them, and the sourcing requirements for each data point.
