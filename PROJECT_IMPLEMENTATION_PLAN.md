# PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
## Production Gap & Cargo Forecast Web App (Front-End Only)
### ‚ú® Enhanced with User Research Findings (see USER_REQUIREMENTS.md)

---

## üéØ **USER REQUIREMENTS INTEGRATION**

### **Primary User Roles (Added from User Research):**
1. **Production Monitoring Engineers** - Alert monitoring
2. **Performance Management Engineers** - Performance insights, reporting  
3. **Production Programmers** - System optimization, cargo planning, constraint resolution

### **Key Operational Context:**
- **Asset Structure**: East and West Assets with identical infrastructure and production units
- **Work Environment**: Production Monitoring Center and office environments
- **Primary KPIs**: Total volume vs capacity, terminal endurance days, cargo export readiness
- **Critical Features**: Role-based dashboards, asset hierarchy navigation, terminal operations

### **Enhanced Implementation Strategy:**
‚úÖ **Core TRS Compliance** - All original technical specifications maintained  
üéØ **User-Centered Enhancements** - Role-based features and workflows added  
üè≠ **Operational Reality** - Asset hierarchy and production unit drill-down capability  

---

## PHASE BREAKDOWN STRATEGY

This implementation follows the **Technical Requirement Specification (TRS)** exactly, divided into 6 phases to minimize errors and ensure quality at each checkpoint.

**SECURITY STRATEGY**: Rapid prototyping with security-ready architecture. Build core functionality first, then add enterprise security layer in post-Phase 6 hardening.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY-AWARE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

### **Current Strategy: Option 1 - Prototype First, Secure Later**
- **Rationale**: Faster time-to-value, stakeholder demos, prove concept before heavy security investment
- **Approach**: Embed security-friendly patterns during development for easy hardening later
- **Timeline**: Security layer added post-Phase 6 before enterprise deployment

### **Security Checkpoints Built Into Phases:**
- **Phase 2**: Structure API layer for easy auth integration
- **Phase 3**: Add `src/security/` placeholder directory  
- **Phase 4**: Environment configs ready for production secrets
- **Phase 5**: Document all data flows and user inputs
- **Phase 6**: Security review preparation, architecture documentation

### **Post-Phase 6 Security Hardening (Separate Sprint):**
- Replace MSW mocks with real API + authentication
- Implement CSP, security headers, HTTPS enforcement
- Add JWT token handling, session management
- OWASP Top 10 compliance review
- Penetration testing on staging environment
- Enterprise security audit
